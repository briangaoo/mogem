              the list of cosmetics you own, the slug of whichever
              cosmetic you have equipped in each slot, and the
              timestamp when each item was granted. Cosmetics are
              purely decorative: they change how your display name

              leaderboards, battle tiles, and follower lists, and
              they do not affect scores, matchmaking, ELO, or any

              When you file a report against an opponent after a
              public 1v1 battle, we email a holymog operator the
              report reason, your optional written details, both
              participant user IDs, the battle ID, and a 7-day signed
              link to the reported player&rsquo;s saved peak frame
              from the &ldquo;battle peak frames&rdquo; bucket. The
              operator clicks Ban or Dismiss; either action is
              recorded in our audit log and tied to the resolved
              report row. The reported player is{' '}
              <span className="font-semibold">not notified</span> when
              a report is filed or dismissed &mdash; only when an
              operator clicks &ldquo;Ban&rdquo;, in which case the
              banned user receives an email explaining the action,
              every active session is purged, and sign-in is blocked
              going forward. The reporter is never told the outcome.
              Banned users may appeal by emailing{' '}

              We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and
              physical safeguards to protect personal information,
              including: TLS-encrypted transport, hashed credentials
              managed by Auth.js, environment-secret separation,
              server-side rate limiting, and access controls on our
              database and storage buckets. However, no method of
              transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is
              100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

            <p>
              In the event of a personal data breach, where required by
              applicable law we will notify the relevant supervisory
              authority{' '}

              (consistent with GDPR Art. 33). We will also notify
              affected users without undue delay where the breach is
              likely to result in a high risk to their rights and
              freedoms, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
