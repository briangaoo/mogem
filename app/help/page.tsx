            Your photo is sent to <strong>Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite</strong>{' '}
            (Google&apos;s vision model) with a calibrated rubric we built. It
            scores 30 individual fields (jawline, eyes, skin tone, canthal tilt,
            symmetry, …), and we combine them into a single 0–100 overall and a
            tier letter from <strong>F-</strong> up to <strong>S+</strong>. The
            heavy scan uses 2 captured frames × 3 category prompts so the model
            sees you under slightly different lighting / micro-expressions, and
            the per-field scores are averaged across frames.

            The rubric is anchored against a working-pro fashion-model standard,
            so most people land between 50 and 80 (average to hot). The model
            isn&apos;t flattery — it actively penalises generic-attractive
            features that don&apos;t hit working-model territory. If you think
            your score doesn&apos;t reflect reality, take more scans: lighting,
            angle, and stability all affect the result, and your{' '}
            <strong>best</strong> scan is what counts for the leaderboard.
