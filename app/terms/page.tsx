                you request individual deletion, or (c) three (3) years
                after your last interaction with the Service —

                <span className="font-semibold">never publicly readable</span>
                ; images are served only via short-lived authenticated
                URLs after we verify ownership. The archive serves
                three purposes: (i) so you can review your record-
                scoring photo from your account; (ii) integrity review
                of high-score submissions (see below); (iii) source-of-

                public leaderboard. Public leaderboard photos (opt-in,
                optional at every tier) are stored in a separate public
                bucket and deleted within thirty (30) days of removal,
                account deletion, or deletion request. Battle-frame
                images are forwarded to the AI model, scored, and
                discarded immediately; we do not persist them.
                Anonymous (non-signed-in) scan images are not retained
                at all. All biometric identifiers will be permanently
                destroyed when the initial purpose for collection has
                been satisfied, or per the retention schedule above.

              The Service includes an in-app system of decorative
              cosmetic items that change how your display name and
              avatar appear to other users on profile pages,
              leaderboards, battle tiles, and follower lists. The
              system is permission-gated by gameplay: cosmetic items
              unlock by hitting specific milestones (for example,
              completing your first scan, scanning at a given tier,
              winning a number of battles, or reaching an ELO
              threshold).

            <p>
              At the current release of the Service (&ldquo;Launch
              1&rdquo;), the cosmetic catalog is limited to{' '}
              <span className="font-semibold">name effects</span>{' '}
              (subtle text-decoration treatments applied to your
              display name) and is{' '}
              <span className="font-semibold">entirely free</span>:
              every cosmetic is earned through gameplay, none can be
              purchased, and no payments are processed through the
              Service. Cosmetics are purely decorative &mdash;
              equipping or unequipping a cosmetic does not affect
              your scores, your matchmaking, your ELO, or any other
              functional aspect of the Service.

              We may, in our sole discretion, add, modify, retire,
              replace, rebalance, or remove cosmetic items,
              achievement thresholds, or the slots in which
              cosmetics render, with or without notice. Retiring or
              renaming a specific cosmetic does not entitle you to
              any refund (no payments are involved at Launch 1) or
              to an equivalent replacement item.

              A future update may add a paid layer to this system,
              including one-time cosmetic purchases, a subscription
              tier (&ldquo;holymog+&rdquo;), or both. If and when
              that layer ships, additional terms governing
              purchases, subscriptions, refunds, taxes, and the
              legal relationship of paid items to your account will
              be added to these Terms and prominently disclosed
              before any payment is collected through the Service.
              Until that update ships, no payment-related terms in
              these Terms apply to you because no payments are
              being processed.
